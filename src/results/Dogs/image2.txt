If your favourite dog is the Husky, you're probably very vocal. Some might call it
whining, but hey as long as you get what you want, right? You're not too
worried about keeping things tidy, because life shouldn't only be about
making beds and unloading the dishwasher.
You seem cold on the outside but as soon as you warm up and get confidence, you're loved by everyone.
