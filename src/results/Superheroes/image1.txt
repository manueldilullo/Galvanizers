If you like Batman the best, you tend to be a do-gooder that prefers not to have all the accolades.
You tend to work behind the scenes and prefer not to have the attention of the white hot spot light.
You have a strong sense of right and wrong and you are prone to step into action when you feel an injustice has been committed.
You are more likely to be the one who does the work and less likely to be one who takes the microphone and speaks.
